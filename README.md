# Basic-Sentiment-Analysis
Complete 2 weeks project on sentiment analysis using Keras.  It is basically the classification of a movie review based on which one can find whether the movie is positively reviewed or negatively.I used 2 densed layers and 1 embedded layer of the neural network  and able to achieve an accuracy of about 84% on the test sets.
